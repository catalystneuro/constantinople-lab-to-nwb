    "## Neuropixels dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains in vivo extracellular electrophysiology recordings from rats performing a value-based decision-making task. Neural data were acquired using Neuropixels probes (384 channels, 30 kHz sampling rate) with Neuropix-PXI hardware and OpenEphys, and preprocessed using Kilosort 2.5 with manual curation in Phy. Trials were initiated by a nose-poke in a lit center port and required maintaining a center fixation for 0.8 to 1.2 seconds, during which a tone indicated the possible reward size. A subsequent side LED indicated the potential reward location, followed by a delay period drawn from an exponential distribution (mean = 2.5 s). Rats could opt out at any time by poking the unlit port, restarting the trial. Catch trials, where the delay period only ended if the rat opted out, constituted 15-25% of the trials. Rats received penalties for premature fixation breaks. Additionally, the tasks introduced semi-observable hidden states by varying reward statistics across uncued blocks (high, low, and mixed), structured hierarchically, with blocks transitioning after 40 successfully completed trials.\n",
