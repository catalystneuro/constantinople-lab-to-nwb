    This dataset contains in vivo extracellular electrophysiology recordings from rats performing a value-based
    decision-making task. Neural data were acquired using Neuropixels probes (384 channels, 30 kHz sampling rate) with
    Neuropix-PXI hardware and OpenEphys, and preprocessed using Kilosort 2.5 with manual curation in Phy.
    Trials were initiated by a nose-poke in a lit center port and required maintaining a center fixation for 0.8 to 1.2
    seconds, during which a tone indicated the possible reward size. A subsequent side LED indicated the potential
    reward location, followed by a delay period drawn from an exponential distribution (mean = 2.5 s). Rats could opt
    out at any time by poking the unlit port, restarting the trial. Catch trials, where the delay period only ended if
    the rat opted out, constituted 15-25% of the trials. Rats received penalties for premature fixation breaks.
    Additionally, the tasks introduced semi-observable hidden states by varying reward statistics across uncued blocks
    (high, low, and mixed), structured hierarchically, with blocks transitioning after 40 successfully completed trials.

    This session contains extracellular electrophysiology acquired from 384 channels at 30 kHz using Neuropix-PXI hardware and OpenEphys.
    The neural data were preprocessed using Kilosort 2.5. After preprocessing, clusters that were identified from Kilosort as single-units
    were manually inspected using Phy. The behavioral tasks were conducted in a high-throughput facility where rats
    were trained in increasingly complex protocols. Trials were initiated by a nose-poke in a lit center port and
    required maintaining a center fixation for 0.8 to 1.2 seconds, during which a tone indicated the possible reward
    size. A subsequent side LED indicated the potential reward location, followed by a delay period drawn from an
    exponential distribution (mean = 2.5 s). Rats could opt out at any time by poking the unlit port, restarting the
    trial. Catch trials, where the delay period only ended if the rat opted out, constituted 15-25% of the trials.
