      - name: optical_fiber
        description: Chronically implantable optic fibers (Thor labs) with 400 Âµm core, 0.5 NA fiber optics were implanted unilaterally over the injection site (DV -6.7). Doric Lenses hardware and software (Doric Neuroscience Studio) were used to record fluorescence. Two-channel motion artifact correction (TMAC) was used to correct for movement artifacts, with mCherry as the activity-independent channel.
